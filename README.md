# test-assignment

To initialise the project run Yarn in root and in packages folders.

Then run yarn start to display the project localy.

## Main focus was on data filters

## Did not make it to charts

- Data to filterd and shaped before display charts is a first step.
- Next Step would have been to set up charts, for each filter.

-Using Node Express/tRPC on backend
-Parsed CSV fo JSON
-Sent To FrontEnd
-Set up Infrastructure to receive data
-Set up filters by categories - easily can add more filters per category

# Next steps

-Filter by date - spent a lot of time to create scrollabletabgroup date picker to get correct dates

-Create buttons to select filter options and display desired data.
